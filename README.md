# Install locally

1. Clone master
2. npm install for both front & backend
3. Launch postgres db running in docker container with 'npm run database' -script
  - settings can be managed via .env and docker.env files ( that are published in repo, which is normally bad practice)
4. npm start for front & backend
5. Go to clients port (default 3000) to experience the wild Solita-name experience
